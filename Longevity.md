# Project Overview
Two sample Mendelian Randomization Analysis on GWAS of human lifespan looking at new and known exposure relationships related to longevity outcomes.

## A. Exposures

Exposures are obtained from the mrbase.org website from the following catalogs
  - NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog
  - MR BASE GWAS catalog
  - Gene Expression QTLs
  - Protein Level QTLs
  - Metabolite Level OTLs
  - Methylation Level QTLs

## B. Outcomes

### I. First Outcome: cases 90

Outcome Data obtained from CPMC that was utilized in Deelen et al., 2019 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413261/). Exposure - Outcome relationships will be examined in persons whose longevity is in the 90th percentile using the rest of the cohort as the control.


### II. Second outcome: cases 99

Using data from section I, compare persons in the 90th percentile with persons in the 99th percentile. 

### III. Third Outcome: UK Biobank

Compare persons in the 90th percentile from section I to those in the 90th percentile from the UK Biobank

### IV. Fourth Outcome: UK Biobank Parental Longevity
