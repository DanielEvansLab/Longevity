# Project Overview
Two sample Mendelian Randomization Analysis on GWAS of human lifespan looking at new and known exposure relationships related to longevity outcomes.

## A. Exposures

Exposures are obtained from the mrbase.org website from the following catalogs
  - NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog
  - MR BASE GWAS catalog
  - Gene Expression QTLs
  - Protein Level QTLs
  - Metabolite Level OTLs
  - Methylation Level QTLs

## B. Outcomes

Outcome Data obtained from CPMC that was utilized in Deelen et al., 2019 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31413261/)
and from UK Biobank.

## C. Analysis
TwoSampleMR package in R was used for analysis.
