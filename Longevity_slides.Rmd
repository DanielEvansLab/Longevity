**Two Sample Mendelian Randomization**

- Exposure: SNPs as a proxy for Exposure from one dataset
- Outcome: outcome from another dataset using SNPs from Exposure to assess the causal relationship between Exposure and Outcome, bypassing confounders that influence the E-O relationship.

**Assumptions** 

1. SNPs truly associated with Exposure, as seem from independent studies

2. SNPs not associated with E-O confounders

3. SNPs are associated with outcome through Exposure only. (Horizontal pleiotropy)

**Limitations**

- weak instrument bias
- very few SNPs for an exposure
- low power ??
- horizontal pleiotropy
- LD
- developmenal compensation
- complex biological pathways
- winnder's curse
- trait heterogeneity
- collider bias
